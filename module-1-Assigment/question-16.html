    <!-- Question-(16)

    → How are active links different from normal links?

    Ans:- 

    → Some browsers recognize an active link when the mouse cursor is placed over that link; others recognize active links when the link
     has the focus. Those that don't have a mouse cursor over that link is considered a normal link. Some browser recognize active links
     when the mouse cursor is placed over that link.


    → An active link is a link that can be clicked on to take you to another page or website. A normal link is a link that can't be
     licked on. But instead provides information about the linked content. -->
