    <!-- Question-(7)
        
     → What is the difference between the 'id' attribute and the 'class' attribute of HTML
       elements? With Example.

       Ans:- 
       → The basic difference between ID and Class is that the ID selector is applied only to one element in a page,
         whereas the class selector can be applied to several elements on a single page.

         * Attribute ID *

        → In HTML, the "id" selector is used id attribute of an element. For an HTML element, 
          the "id" name starts with the symbol '#' followed by a unique name.
          One important characteristics of the id element is that we can only attach one id selector to an element. 
          Hence, the ID selector is always unique within an HTML page.

          * Attribute CLASS *
        → In HTML, the "class" selector is used to select an element with a specific class attribute. 
          The class selector starts with a period (.) followed by a class name. Unlike the id selector, 
          we can attach multiple selector to an HTML element. Therefore, the class can be applied many time within a page.
          The important point to note about the class selector is that the class name must not be started with a number. -->
