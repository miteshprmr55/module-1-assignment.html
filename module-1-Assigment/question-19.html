    <!-- Question-(19)

    → What is difference between HTML and XHTML?

    Ans:- 

    → * HTML *

    →  HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, whereas XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language. XHTML is basically an
      extension of HTML, which is stricter than HTML. Both languages are used to create web and Android applications. HTML is SGML based,
      whereas XHTML is an XML-based language.

    * XHTML *

    →  XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to work with other data formats (such as XML). In addition, browsers 
     ignore errors in HTML pages, and try to display the website even if it has some errors in the markup. So XHTML comes with a much 
     stricter error handling.

     →  HTML is less secure
        XHTML provides more security

     →  HTML is supported by all browsers
        Only few browsers support XHTML

     →  It has simple syntax and can be understood easily
        Beginners find it difficult to understand -->
